Who were the coaches in both seasons? Were there any notable changes in the coaching lineup between the two seasons? Please provide specific details about the winners and the coaching dynamics. Let's dive into the details about the winners of The Voice Season 23 and Season 22, the margin of victory in Season 23, and the coaching lineups for both seasons.\\n\\n**Season 23 Winner:**\\n\\n- **Winner:** Gina Miles\\n\\n- **Coach:** Niall Horan\\n\\n- **Margin of Victory:** The smallest margin to date, as noted by host Carson Daly.\\n\\nGina Miles, a 19-year-old singer from Paxton, Illinois, was crowned the winner of Season 23 on May 23, 2023. Her victory marked Niall Horan's first win as a coach, making him the third new coach to win on his debut season, following Kelly Clarkson and John Legend.\\n\\n**Season 22 Winner:**\\n\\n- **Winner:** Bryce Leatherwood\\n\\n- **Coach:** Blake Shelton\\n\\n- **Notable Information:** Bryce Leatherwood's victory was particularly significant as it was the first time a contestant saved by a Wild Card instant save went on to win the competition. Additionally, his win marked Blake Shelton's ninth and final victory as a coach.\\n\\n**Coaching Lineup for Season 23:**\\n\\n- **Coaches:**\\n\\n  - Blake Shelton (23rd and final season)\\n\\n  - Kelly Clarkson (9th season, returning after a one-season hiatus)\\n\\n  - Chance the Rapper (debut)\\n\\n  - Niall Horan (debut)\\n\\n**Coaching Lineup for Season 22:**\\n\\n- **Coaches:**\\n\\n  - Blake Shelton (22nd season)\\n\\n  - John Legend (7th season)\\n\\n  - Gwen Stefani (6th season, returning after a hiatus)\\n\\n  - Camila Cabello (2nd season, first time as a full coach)\\n\\n**Notable Changes Between Seasons 22 and 23:**\\n\\n- **Season 22:**\\n\\n  - Coaches: Blake Shelton, John Legend, Gwen Stefani, Camila Cabello\\n\\n  - Notable: Gwen Stefani returned after a hiatus, and Camila Cabello made her full coaching debut.\\n\\n- **Season 23:**\\n\\n  - Coaches: Blake Shelton, Kelly Clarkson, Chance\",\n          \" Based on the provided documents, the Democrats retained control of the Senate after the 2022 midterm elections. However, the documents suggest that the Republicans are likely to gain control of the House. One document states, \\\"The Democrats will retain majority control of the US Senate after winning a pivotal race in the state of Nevada,\\\" while another mentions, \\\"Republicans could try to win over Democratic Senate moderates on some legislation,\\\" implying that the Democrats might still control the Senate but that the House could be controlled by Republicans. Another document specifically says, \\\"a Democratic loss in the House of fewer than 12 seats would be very unexpected,\\\" suggesting that the Democrats are likely to lose control of the House.\\n\\nTherefore, it appears that after the 2022 midterm elections, the Democrats control the Senate, and the Republicans control the House.\",\n          \" In Shazam!

This suggests that the Democrats were in control of the House before the midterms. However, the document also indicates that a Democratic loss of fewer than 12 seats would be unexpected, implying that the Democrats are likely to lose control of the House.\\n\\nGiven that the document does not explicitly state the final control of the House after the midterms, the most accurate answer is:\\n\\n- **Senate**: Democrats have a 51-49 majority.\\n- **House**: The control of the House is not explicitly mentioned in the document, but the information suggests that the Democrats are likely to lose control of the House.\\n\\nTherefore, the Democrats control the Senate, but the control of the House is still undecided based on the provided information. If you need a more definitive answer on the House control, additional information would be required. \\n\\nWould you like to provide more recent or specific information about the House control?

The tournament airs live on NBC Sports, Peacock and Tennis Channel through championship points in Paris. Novak Djokovic is not only bidding for a third crown at Roland Garros, but also to lift a 23rd Grand Slam singles trophy to break his tie with Nadal for the most in men’s history.

The only match during which there was even a murmur of concern for the Polish prodigy came when she lost a first-set tie-break to\\xa0Zheng Qinwen in the fourth round — the solitary set she lost during her run to the title. A post shared by Iga Świątek (@iga.swiatek)  Swiatek won 24 of her 31 games during her semifinal and final, cruising past Coco Gauff 6-1, 6-3 in the showpiece to repeat her achievement of 2020. Nadal is the undisputed king of clay but Swedish legend Bjorn Borg was the most successful player before the Spaniard's era of domination, winning the tournament six times in eight years.\\xa0 Spain have had the most men's singles success in the Open Era, accounting for 19 champions. Czech Krejcikova became the second unseeded player in as many years to win the tournament when she dethroned Swiatek in 2021.\", 'MADRID, SPAIN - MAY 07: Carlos Alcaraz of Spain greets Novak Djokovic of Serbia after winning during the Mutua Madrid Open 2022 celebrated at La Caja Magica on May 07, 2022, in Madrid, Spain.

Barroso/Europa Press via Getty Images) Europa Press via Getty Images The French Open men’s singles draw is missing injured 14-time champion Rafael Nadal for the first time since 2004, leaving the Coupe des Mousquetaires ripe for the taking. The tournament airs live on NBC Sports, Peacock and Tennis Channel through championship points in Paris. Novak Djokovic is not only bidding for a third crown at Roland Garros, but also to lift a 23rd Grand Slam singles trophy to break his tie with Nadal for the most in men’s history. He can also become the first man to win all four majors at least three times and, at 36, the oldest French Open men’s or women’s singles champion. FRENCH OPEN: Broadcast Schedule | Women’s Draw Djokovic took out No. 1 seed Carlos Alcaraz in the semifinals, advancing to a final against 2022 French Open runner-up Casper Ruud of Norway. Russian Daniil Medvedev, the No. 2 seed, was upset in the first round by 172nd-ranked Brazilian qualifier Thiago Seyboth Wild.', \"Jun 4, 2022 ...

            "Negative doc [\"Iga Świątek defeated Coco Gauff in the final, 6–1, 6–3 to win the women's singles tennis title at the 2022 French Open.[1] It was her second French Open title, and she dropped just one set en route, in the fourth round to Zheng Qinwen. With the win, Świątek extended her winning streak to 35 matches (dating back to the Qatar Open in February), equaling Venus Williams' tally from the 2000 season.[2] Świątek also became the youngest winner of multiple majors since Maria Sharapova in 2006.[3]  Barbora Krejčíková was the defending champion,[4] but she lost in the first round to Diane Parry. This marked only the third time in French Open history that the defending champion lost in the first round (after Anastasia Myskina in 2005 and Jeļena Ostapenko in 2018), and the record fifteenth consecutive unsuccessful French Open women's singles title defense since 2007.[5]  17-year-old Linda Nosková became the youngest qualifier to debut in the main draw since Michelle Larcher de Brito in 2009.[6][7][8][9] This was the second time in the Open Era when only one out of the top ten seeds advanced to the fourth round of a major, after 2018 Wimbledon.[10]\"]\n",
