Jobs recognized the limitations of third-party retailing and began investigating options to change the model.[4]  In 1999, Jobs personally recruited Millard Drexler, former CEO of Gap Inc., to serve on Apple\\'s board of directors.[4][68][69] In 2000, Jobs hired Ron Johnson from Target. The retail and development teams headed by Allen Moyer from The Walt Disney Company then began a series of mock-ups for the Apple Store inside a warehouse near the company\\'s Cupertino headquarters.[4]  On May 15, 2001, Jobs hosted a press event at Apple\\'s first store, located at the Tysons Corner Center mall in Tysons, Virginia, near Washington, D.C.[70] The store officially opened on May 19, along with another store in Glendale Galleria in Glendale, California.[70][4][71] More than 7,700 people visited Apple\\'s first two stores in the opening weekend, spending a total of US$599,000.[72]  Several publications and analysts predicted the failure of Apple Stores.', 'The company’s contract manufacturing partners, Foxconn and Wistron, have increased local assembly of iPhones and other Apple devices in recent quarters. According to a report by JP Morgan analysts last year, Apple is expected to expand its manufacturing capacity in India to produce 25% of all iPhones by 2025.', 'The Apple Store is a chain of retail stores owned and operated by Apple Inc. The stores sell ... The first Apple Stores were originally opened as two locations in May\\xa0...', 'Apr 13, 2023 ... Apple is set to open its first two India stores - but will they help its fortunes in an Android-heavy market?', \"The Apple Store is a chain of retail stores owned and operated by Apple Inc. The stores sell various Apple products, including Mac personal computers, iPhone smartphones, iPad tablet computers, Apple Watch smartwatches, Apple TV digital media players, software, and both Apple-branded and selected third-party accessories.  The first Apple Stores were originally opened as two locations in May 2001 by then-CEO Steve Jobs, after years of attempting but failing store-within-a-store concepts. Seeing a need for improved retail presentation of the company's products, he began an effort in 1997 to revamp the retail program to get an improved relationship with consumers and hired Ron Johnson in 2000. Jobs relaunched Apple's online store in 1997 and opened the first two physical stores in 2001. The media initially speculated that Apple would fail, but its stores were highly successful, bypassing the sales numbers of competing nearby stores and within three years reached US$1\\xa0billion in annual sales, becoming the fastest retailer in history to do so. Apple has expanded the number of retail locations and its geographical coverage over the years, with 526 stores across 26 countries and regions worldwide, opening its latest store in the Battersea district of London, United Kingdom on June 15, 2023.[2][3] Strong product sales have placed Apple among the top-tier retail stores, with sales over $16\\xa0billion globally in 2011.\", 'Mr Roy says that Apple\\'s decision to open physical stores in India could be the next step in its branding strategy. \"It\\'s not as if this will change Apple sales in any dramatic way,\" he adds, \"but it is still a key milestone, one that will allow Apple to deliver to Indian customers the full Apple experience\". Spacious, carefully curated and full of artful displays and clever designs, these stores are projected as the physical embodiment of the Apple brand itself. \"The excitement to visit these stores is an experience of its own,\" Mr Roy says.  He adds that setting up an Apple store in India is also a statement that the country is \"now big enough for Apple to be actually interested in expanding operations here\" in more than one way.  Apple first began making a lower-end model of the iPhone in India in 2017 in the southern state of Tamil Nadu. Last year it began producing its latest model of iPhone 14 in the country, which now accounts for 5% of total iPhone production.  For years, Apple had relied on China\\'s sophisticated manufacturing network to produce the bulk of its products. But its dependence on the country was strained after Beijing announced its \"zero-Covid\" policy, leading to months of industrial lockouts and massive supply chain disruptions. \"India\\'s Holy Grail would be to get a big iconic brand like Apple to move from China to India. And it has done it with Apple,\" Mr Roy says.', 'The company has more than 70 highly skilled retail team members at Apple Saket Store, who come from a combined 18 states in India and collectively speak more than 15 languages.

That factory is run by the Taiwanese firm Foxconn. Wedbush\\'s Ives said Apple\\'s India strategy — with both a retail and manufacturing push — mirrors the technology giant\\'s steps it took in the China market 10 years ago. \"As Foxconn/Apple put more skin in the game on the iPhone production front within India this will go hand in hand with a bigger retail presence within India as seen this week which mirrors the early days of the China penetration strategy going back a decade,\" Ives said. \"Rome was not built overnight and neither will Apple\\'s broader India strategy, however, we view this week as Apple diving into the deep end of the pool in India as this massive market slowly converts into the Apple ecosystem over the coming years with iPhone market share gains front and center.\" Correction: This story has been updated to accurately reflect the name of Dan Ives.

A Division of NBCUniversal Data is a real-time snapshot *Data is delayed at least 15 minutes.', 'And in Delhi are eager customers like Amar Bhasin, 41, whose first cellphone, bought 18 years ago, was a Panasonic. More recently, he bought an iPad from an Indian outlet, only to discover that its screen was cracked. The store refused to exchange it, and local service centers weren’t helpful. So Mr. Bhasin addressed a letter to Mr. Cook himself — and a month later, a new iPad appeared in the mail. “I felt so good, and became an Apple fan instantly — who does that?” Mr. Bhasin said, standing before the still-shrouded Apple Saket. “I don’t see myself buying another brand in the foreseeable future.” India is an important frontier for Apple. It was by far the biggest country to lack an outlet bearing its own brand. Some much smaller countries have multiple Apple stores: Switzerland has four, and even Macau, a Chinese territory with a population of 680,000, or 0.5 percent of India’s, has two. But those countries are something India is not: rich. Even the lower- to middle-income countries with Apple stores, such as Brazil, Thailand and Turkey, have per-capita incomes several times higher than India’s. In a potential market so big, Apple does not need to make much of a dent to earn back its investment. The company’s market share in India has been growing rapidly.', 'But most of these products are too high end for a country like India where a bulk of the market is not in the premium segment,\" says Prasanto K Roy, who has worked extensively on issues of technology and public policy.  Apple has long tried to open physical retail stores in India - its original plans for 2021 were derailed because of the Covid-19 pandemic.  For years, the company had asked the Indian government to loosen rules that required foreign-owned single-brand retailers to obtain 30% of the value of products sold in India from suppliers in the country. Apple had argued the figure was unrealistic - at least in the short term - as it virtually made all its devices in China.  In 2019, the Indian government relaxed some investment rules, exempting companies selling \"cutting-edge\" items, such as Apple\\'s iPhones and iPads, from the requirement. The next year, announcing Apple\\'s plans to open a physical store in India, Mr Cook had said the company had been waiting for approval from the Indian government \"to go in there ourselves\" rather than with a domestic partner. \"I don\\'t want somebody else to run the brand for us,\" he told shareholders. The next year, Apple launched an online store in India. The website, which allows users to ask for customised products, got a \"great reaction\", according to the company.']\n",

In the end, he was unable to participate after his visa was cancelled twice by Australian Immigration Minister Alex Hawke.[3]  The 2022 Australian Open was the 110th edition of the tournament, held at Melbourne Park in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. The tournament returned to its traditional January slot after the 2021 tournament was held in February after a precaution over concerns with the strict COVID-19 protocols.  The tournament was run by the International Tennis Federation (ITF) and is part of the 2022 ATP Tour and the 2022 WTA Tour calendars under the Grand Slam category. The tournament consisted of both men's and women's singles and doubles draws as well as the mixed doubles events. There were singles and doubles events for both boys and girls (players under 18), which are part of the Grade A category of tournaments.  The junior competitions returned after a year of absence.[4] There are also singles, doubles and quad events for men's and women's wheelchair tennis players as part of the NEC tour under the Grand Slam category.  The tournament was played on hard courts and took place across a series of 25 courts, including the four main show courts of Rod Laver Arena, John Cain Arena, Margaret Court Arena and 1573 Arena. It was also the debut of Kia Arena, which made for five main tennis arenas.\", 'After a first set that was over in 30 minutes, Swiatek and Jabeur took 81 minutes to finish the second as Jabeur battled back from a service break down twice to get the set into a tiebreaker before Swiatek ultimately prevailed. Swiatek, 21, won the French Open in 2020 and 2022, becoming the first Polish woman to win a Grand Slam singles title. And now she is the first Polish woman to win three and the U.S. Open, where she was the first Polish woman to make the singles final. How young is this new tennis queen? She is Gen-Z to the core. After the extended congratulatory hug with Jabeur, and a little bit of celebrating, she took a seat in her chair, pulled her phone from her bag and texted away as she awaited the trophy ceremony  For Swiatek, the victory was the latest success in a season full of them. She won 37 consecutive matches and six consecutive titles from late winter to early summer. Those victories included the so-called Sunshine Double — winning both the BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells, Calif., and the Miami Open in March and April. Those wins, on hard courts similar to those at the U.S. Open, announced Swiatek as a force on courts other than clay, on which she was already dominant.', 'This is your moment, @SabalenkaA 🙌#AusOpen • #AO2023 pic.twitter.com/EI91Y0NLIQ The emotions flow, though there is respect between the players at the net. Tears in Sabalenka’s eyes, and a shy smile from Rybakina. The Wimbledon champ got overpowered in the end but played her full part in a classic final, really one to remember. Rybakina makes a mess of a backhand chance for a winner. 15-0. But a poor second serve takes it to 15-15. There are wobbles on the Sabalenka serve, and 15-30 it is. Nerves very visibly creeping in. For both players, Rybakina clanks one out of bounds, and it’s 30-30. A huge serve it’s match point all of a sudden. Can she take it? Out on the first serve, and it was massive. But then comes a big one on the second, and a double fault. Another match point with a club forehand down the line. Just in. Another chance. Another missed first serve. And then Rybakina saves herself. Deuce once more. And then, a top-spun whipped forehand and it’s break point rather than match point. Oh Lordy. Saved by a missile of a serve to the furthest reaches.

Produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, it is the direct sequel to Avengers: Infinity War (2018) and the 22nd film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Directed by Anthony and Joe Russo and written by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, the film features an ensemble cast including Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, Don Cheadle, Paul Rudd, Brie Larson, Karen Gillan, Danai Gurira, Benedict Wong, Jon Favreau, Bradley Cooper, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Josh Brolin. In the film, the surviving members of the Avengers and their allies attempt to reverse Thanos's actions in Infinity War.  The film was announced in October 2014 as Avengers: Infinity War – Part 2, but Marvel later removed this title. The Russo brothers joined as directors in April 2015, with Markus and McFeely signing on to write the script a month later. The film serves as a conclusion to the story of the MCU up to that point, ending the story arcs for several main characters. The plot revisits several moments from earlier films, bringing back actors and settings from throughout the franchise.\", 'October 30, 2020\\t\\t • 3  For the last decade, Marvel has led the adaptations of superhero comic books into films. In 2019, the journey culminated in the release of Avengers: Endgame, which premiered to critical and commercial success. It had gone from a story about a playboy billionaire (Tony Stark/Iron Man) to a larger story than spanned universes as well as heroes and villains alike. Although, as the universe expanded, it was hard to ignore that Marvel’s roster of superheroes still lacked diversity. This was made even more apparent when other superhero stories started to make their way into the mainstream.\\xa0 In the same year that Endgame came out, a quiet and subversive TV show was making waves. The Boys is adapted from a graphic novel of the same name, one that is notorious amongst fans and haters alike for its crude, graphic and violent nature. The series considers what would happen if superheroes existed in the real world. The short answer is that they would become an untouchable commodity that could wreak havoc, which would be cleaned up by their slick and all-powerful parent company Vought. The series touches on power, social media, politics and causes the line between hero and villain to become truly blurred.\\xa0 It is difficult not to draw comparisons between the storylines in The Boys and the reality of the MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe).', '7] The series premiered on February 21, 2022.[2] On May 12, 2022, NBC canceled the series after one season.[3]  On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the series holds a 33% approval rating based on 12 reviews, with an average rating of 5.4/10. The website\\'s critics consensus reads, \"While Morena Baccarin\\'s vampish performance is commendably campy, The Endgame is too contrived and silly to justify its labyrinthine structure.\"[19] On Metacritic, the series has a score of 44 out of 100, based on 7 reviews, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".[20]', 'Scott gave the film a positive though guarded review, stating, \"Endgame is a monument to adequacy, a fitting capstone to an enterprise that figured out how to be good enough for enough people enough of the time. Not that it\\'s really over, of course: Disney and Marvel are still working out new wrinkles in the time-money continuum. But the Russos do provide the sense of an ending, a chance to appreciate what has been done before the timelines reset and we all get back to work.\"[196] Justin Chang of the Los Angeles Times wrote that \"Avengers: Endgame achieves and earns its climactic surge of feeling, even as it falls just short of real catharsis\".[197] Some have noted the film as a notable improvement over its predecessor, Avengers: Infinity War, such as Brian Tallerico of RogerEbert.com, who stated that Endgame is \"a more patient, focused film [than Infinity War], even as its plot draws in elements of a dozen other movies.\"[198] Matt Zoller Seitz, also of RogerEbert.com, gave the film a positive assessment as compared with Infinity War, which he considered \"too crowded, too rushed and yet too long\". Seitz stated that Endgame is \"a heartfelt and satisfying experience\", along with being a \"surprisingly relaxed, character-driven, self-aware yet sincere comedy [for] two-thirds of [the film].', 'Much of the script suggests a laid-back Richard Linklater movie with superheroes\".[199] Joe Morgenstern of The Wall Street Journal acknowledged the unique achievement that Avengers: Endgame accomplished as the conclusion of the Infinity Saga, calling the final battle \"inevitably unwieldy [...] but thrilling all the same, and followed by a delicate coda. So many stories. So many adventures. So much to sort out before the next cycle starts.\"[200]  Richard Brody, writing for The New Yorker, was more critical of the film, opining that the good acting was not matched by comparable skill from the directors. He said, \"The Russos have peculiarly little sense of visual pleasure, little sense of beauty, little sense of metaphor, little aptitude for texture or composition; their spectacular conceit is purely one of scale, which is why their finest moments are quiet and dramatic ones\".[201] Anthony Lane of The New Yorker gave the film a compromising review, finding it to be overdeveloped and overwrought, stating, \"The one thing you do need to know about Avengers: Endgame is that it runs for a little over three hours, and that you can easily duck out during the middle hour, do some shopping, and slip back into your seat for the climax. You won\\'t have missed a thing.\"[202]  At the 92nd Academy Awards, Avengers: Endgame received a nomination for Best Visual Effects.', '108] Lola also aged-up Evans for the final scene where he is portrayed as an elderly man, using some make-up and a stand-in as reference.[106] Jeffrey Ford and Matthew Schmidt served as the film\\'s editors.[109]  In June 2016, Alan Silvestri, who composed the score for The Avengers, was revealed to be returning to score both Infinity War and Endgame.[110] The Russos started working with Silvestri on the Endgame score in early November 2018,[111] and it was completed in late March 2019.[112] A soundtrack album featuring Silvestri\\'s score was released by Hollywood Records digitally on April 26, 2019, with a physical release on May 24.[113] A video for the track \"Portals\", composed for the climactic scene in which reinforcements arrive for the Avengers, was released on June 13.[114]  Silvestri described the score as having the most versatile tone of the franchise, ranging from \"thunderous percussion and powerful brass\" for the action sequences to minimalist, jazz-inspired music for Ant-Man and the Quantum Realm. Silvestri reprises his themes from the previous Avengers films and Captain America: The First Avenger, including material he wrote for Thanos and the Infinity Stones in Infinity War. He found writing the music to end Captain America\\'s story poignant, since he had \"been on this journey with him since the beginning\".', \"134] The film was released in Australia, China, and other parts of Asia and Europe on April 24,[135] in the United Kingdom on April 25,[136] in the United States and India on April 26,[103][135] and in Russia on April 29,[135] in IMAX and 3D.[137][138] It was originally scheduled to be released in the United States on May 3.[77] Radio Liberty alleged that the Russian government postponed the film's release in that country to promote Russian-produced films.[139] Avengers: Endgame is part of Phase Three of the MCU.[140]  Following the release of the second trailer for Marvel Studios' Spider-Man: Far From Home (2019) on May 6, Marvel began showing it at the end of Endgame screenings with a message before the film from Far From Home star Tom Holland telling the audience to stay until the end of the credits to see the trailer.[141] In June, Feige announced that Avengers: Endgame would be re-released in theaters with seven minutes of new post-credits footage, including a Stan Lee tribute, an unfinished deleted scene, and the opening scene of Far From Home. A limited edition poster would also be given out at select theaters. The re-release began on June 28 in the United States, across 1,040 theaters.[142][143]\", 'I don’t know about you but I love a good show or movie that constantly keeps you guessing. You know, the kind of show that makes you think things are going one way and then completely throws you for a loop with a 180 turn in the opposite direction. With shows like these, you’re always on the edge of your seat because you just never know what’s going to happen next. It’s particularly fascinating when this kind of show has an antihero at the center of it, because who could have ever thought that you’d be rooting for the bad guy? That’s why I love a good show with something borderline criminal at its center (think Breaking Bad or Money Heist) – they always bring something unique to the table in terms of storyline and protagonist! In some shows, you really find yourself asking: “Is the bad guy always the villain?” because that’s not always the case. Take some of the shows on this list of TV shows about heists, for example. As thieves, they’re technically the bad guys of society but then again, are they really the bad guys if they’re doing it for a greater good? Sometimes, the answer to that isn’t as simple as black and white. So take your pick of these TV shows about heists, binge-watch them (because trust me, they’re all worthy of a marathon), and judge for yourself whether the thieves really are the villains of the story!', \"In addition to serial killers and drug lords, American popular culture is also invested in the figure of the fraudster. The most recent series to address this is Inventing Anna, which focuses on a young woman who managed to convince many of the most powerful people in the country that she was something she wasn’t. There’s a notable battle of wits in this series, as reporter Vivian Kent won’t rest until she uncovers the truth about this extraordinary individual who seems to be a different person depending on whom she’s talking to.

The loss of Jesus 'Tecatito' Corona to injury is, though, a significant blow. Mexico don’t score or concede many goals — averaging just over one goal a game scored in their qualification bid — and they will hope that compact gameplan, devised by wily former Barcelona coach Gerardo Martino, can prove sufficient to stifle group opponents. Poland’s Robert Lewandowski won the battle of the talismans against Sweden’s Zlatan Ibrahimovic to book the Eastern Europeans a spot in the finals via the playoff route, following a 2-0 win. Poland had previously been given a bye straight through to the final match after first-round opponents Russia were banned by FIFA as a result of their country’s invasion of Ukraine.\\xa0 Their 34-year-old Barcelona striker aside, Poland’s roster consists of plenty of experienced performers who play domestically across Europe. Napoli midfielder Piotr Zielinski should supply valuable chances for Lewandoski to add to his superb international goal tally.

By the end of the day, Argentina and Poland had just a point between them. Here's everything that happened in the 2022 FIFA World Cup today. Saudi Arabia 2, Argentina 1 Argentina is still alive in the tournament after Tuesday's shocking result. Unfortunately, that's where the good news ends for La Albiceleste. History tells us that making out of the group stage is incredibly difficult when you lose your first game, let alone winning the World Cup — only Spain (2010) has accomplished the latter. Argentina's next opponents, Mexico and Poland, are beatable, but as we saw Tuesday, so is Argentina. It's not all good news for Saudi Arabia either. Ironically, it might have even more pressure to get results against Mexico and Poland than before now that qualifying for the knockout stages is a real possibility. But for now, Saudi Arabia is reeling in the fact that it beat one of the tournament favorites, and arguably the greatest player of all time.

In 2011, Childress got into an altercation with Busch in the garage at Kansas Speedway that resulted in NASCAR fining Childress $150,000 and placing him on probation for the rest of the season. Asked at Kansas this past weekend how he could consider driving for Childress considering their history, Busch said: “The first time I sat down with him everything was OK and the biggest thing about it was just having the opportunity to put that behind us.” The inability of JGR to secure a primary sponsor and the lengthy negotiations leading to a new home for Busch in the Cup Series had taken a visible toll on the Las Vegas native in recent weeks. In an interview last month at Watkins Glen, Busch said whatever he decided “there’s a big change coming”. “Is it worth it to go run around and not have an opportunity to win right away versus building something versus jumping in something that can win? All those questions are certainly being weighed out,” he said then. “Again, that’s also why it’s not so simple and so easy. So, thankfully there are opportunities out there, here are Cup jobs available. But again, it will not look the same as what it has for the last 15 years.', 'That aspiration, he said, was clouded by the organization’s search for a top-tier sponsor to replace longtime partner M&M’s/Mars. Busch indicated on Sept. 1 at Cup Series Playoffs Media Day he had multiple offers to consider, and that the negotiation process had weighed on him. “Trust me, my gut doesn’t feel good, and that’s not just for decisions being made, but more so of decisions being weighed and the perception in how you come across to all of those that you’re going to disappoint, right?” Busch said at Media Day. “There’s going to be one winner, and the rest are not winners, if you look at it in that regard.” MORE: Biggest NASCAR free agent signings David Wilson, Toyota Racing Development president, had stressed the importance of keeping Busch in the automaker’s fold as discussions were ongoing, saying that “any other scenario is just unacceptable.” Busch ranks as Toyota’s top winner in all three NASCAR national series with 203 of his 224 total victories achieved during his time with the manufacturer. “I mean, Kyle Busch is our 60-home run hitter,” Wilson said Aug. 27 at Daytona International Speedway. “And we’d be foolish not to put everything in play to keep him in the family.” Joe Gibbs Racing and Toyota are now absorbing the loss of Busch’s looming departure from the heart of their batting order, and both groups will work to fill the vacancy.', '\"But more than that, Kyle has been a friend, part of our family and has played a key role in the development of many of our drivers through his ownership of Kyle Busch Motorsports. We wish nothing but the best for Kyle and his entire family as he moves into the next chapter of his Hall of Fame career. We\\'re thankful to have been along for the ride.\\'\\' Childress said the atmosphere at his shop in Welcome has been electric since rumors started that Busch might move to the organization. He also said when he looks in Busch\\'s eyes, he sees the same fiery look of competition he once saw in the late Dale Earnhardt. Earnhardt won six of his seven Cup championships driving for Childress. But RCR has not won a title since Earnhardt\\'s final championship in 1994. Reddick, a two-race winner this season, is currently 11th in the playoff standings. Austin Dillon, Childress\\' grandson, won the regular-season finale to snag the final playoff spot, is 14th in the standings as the Cup Series heads into Saturday night\\'s elimination race at Bristol Motor Speedway. It was Dillon, Childress said, who encouraged his grandfather to speak to Busch after Reddick blindsided RCR with his plans to leave in 2024. Busch goes into Bristol ranked 13th in the standings.', 'We put all of our differences behind us a while back and he’s a great race driver,” Childress said Aug. 28, after Dillon prevailed in the regular-season finale at Daytona. “He’ll land him a good ride somewhere, for sure.” RELATED: Kyle Busch through the years Busch joked about the long-ago fisticuffs last weekend at Kansas. “Who’s to say he hasn’t punched me again in any of these conversations?” Busch said to laughs. “Whenever you go into negotiations, it’s never fun so you’re duking the whole time. I think you grow up and you work through things, and you talk it over. Really, it was fine the first time I sat down with him. Everything was OK. The biggest thing about it was just having an opportunity to kind of put that behind us.” Kyle Busch qualified for the NASCAR Cup Series Playoffs with a victory earlier this year on the Bristol Motor Speedway dirt. That win in April extended his streak of seasons with at least one Cup Series victory to 18. Busch began his career as a Chevrolet prospect, joining the Cup Series full-time in 2005 with Hendrick Motorsports. He collected four wins with Rick Hendrick’s No. 5 team before his shift to Gibbs’ operation in 2008. Only Denny Hamlin, driver of JGR’s No.', 'under caution during a 2011 Truck Series race at Texas Motor Speedway. He’s amassed several fines for his behavior including directing an obscene gesture at an official during a 2010 Cup race at Texas and for recklessly driving through the garage after crashing out of a 2021 playoff race at Darlington Raceway. Advertisement Busch’s sometimes brash behavior and outspokenness have made him a driver many fans dislike. He is frequently greeted with loud jeers during driver introductions and the same reception often greets him after he wins a race. Despite the trials and tribulations that Busch has put his team through, Joe Gibbs has maintained support for Busch throughout, and few expected that Busch would leave the organization owned by the three-time Super Bowl-winning head coach, NFL Hall of Famer and NASCAR Hall of Famer. JGR is one of NASCAR’s preeminent teams and can provide Busch the caliber of resources and equipment he needs to regularly contend for wins and championships. But as the sponsorship search stretched out, combined with Busch and JGR unable to come to terms on a new contract and Ty Gibbs’ continued emergence, the likelihood increased throughout the summer that Busch would end up leaving. He publicly acknowledged in late July that while his preference was to remain with JGR, he was speaking to other teams lest he would be left without a ride for the 2023 season.', 'NASCAR Cup Kansas: Wallace beats Hamlin in second shock winner Analysis: RCR was not Busch\\'s first NASCAR choice, but it may be his best \\r             NASCAR Cup Michigan: Buescher beats Truex for consecutive wins          NASCAR Cup Michigan: Buescher beats Truex for consecutive wins NASCAR Cup Michigan: Buescher beats Truex for consecutive wins  \\r             Remainder of Michigan NASCAR Cup race postponed to Monday          Remainder of Michigan NASCAR Cup race postponed to Monday Remainder of Michigan NASCAR Cup race postponed to Monday  \\r             How NASCAR is gearing up for its \"biggest change\" in 2022          How NASCAR is gearing up for its \"biggest change\" in 2022 How NASCAR is gearing up for its \"biggest change\" in 2022  \\r             WRC set for 13-round 2024 calendar, Saudi Arabia to miss out          WRC set for 13-round 2024 calendar, Saudi Arabia to miss out WRC set for 13-round 2024 calendar, Saudi Arabia to miss out  \\r             The big questions concerning Leclerc’s Ferrari F1 future          The big questions concerning Leclerc’s Ferrari F1 future The big questions concerning Leclerc’s Ferrari F1 future  \\r             Van Gisbergen predicting steep NASCAR oval learning curve          Van Gisbergen predicting steep NASCAR oval learning curve', 'Sep 13, 2022 ...

Kyle Busch, Joe Gibbs Racing, M&M's Toyota Camry Photo by: David Rosenblum / NKP / Motorsport Images JGR has been unable to secure a primary sponsor for Busch’s #18 Toyota which would be comparable to the size of the financial investment from Mars Inc., although team officials have said they have come “close” on other prospects. That has led Busch to exploring options, including those from other manufacturers. In recent weeks, it was believed Busch was working on two viable options. One was moving to fellow Toyota team 23XI Racing, which is co-owned by Busch’s JGR team-mate Denny Hamlin and NBA legend Michael Jordan. That option was expected to cause the least issue with Busch’s KBM organisation. The other was joining RCR, which was looking for a new infusion of top talent after current driver Reddick informed the team in mid-July that he would not return to the organisation once his current contract expired at the end of the 2023 season.\"]\n",

Hocus Pocus 2 is only weeks away and we\\'ve been given a spooky treat of a new trailer for the eagerly-awaited sequel. The second trailer was debuted at the D23 Expo and it gave us our first look at Hannah Waddingham\\'s role as The Witch, as well as the return of Doug Jones as \"good zombie\" Billy Butcherson. Disney released the first trailer for the highly-anticipated sequel in late June and if you weren\\'t aware of the demand for the movie, the trailer notched up more than 40 million views in its first 24 hours.

As mentioned above, the first trailer for Hocus Pocus 2 arrived on June 28, 2022 and while it was low on plot, it was high on spookiness. The trailer teased the return of the Sanderson Sisters and featured other classic Hocus Pocus items such as the Black Flame Candle.  Disney then revealed the second trailer for Hocus Pocus 2 on September 9, 2022 and it was more plot-focused than the teaser.', 'Omri Katz, Thora Birch, and Vinessa Shaw — who played the trio of kids at the center of the first movie — do not reprise their roles in the sequel.

Few details have been confirmed about the plot of Hocus Pocus 2, but here’s a brief synopsis from IMDB: \"Three young women accidentally bring back the Sanderson Sisters to modern day Salem and must figure out how to stop the child-hungry witches from wreaking havoc on the world.\" Disney+ previously shared a photo of Najimy, Midler and Parker in costume on the set of the sequel shortly after filming started late last year. They\\'re already running amok, amok, amok! 🕯 Bette Midler, Sarah Jessica Parker and Kathy Najimy are in production on #HocusPocus2, coming Fall 2022 on #DisneyPlus. #DisneyPlusDay RELATED: It’s happening! Disney teases ‘Hocus Pocus 2’ for the first time Although an official trailer has not yet been released, a few behind-the-scenes clips have popped up on YouTube as some people shared video from the set last year. You can see some of those moments throughout the videos below... Hocus Pocus has developed a rabid fan base since its release in 1993, becoming one of Halloween’s most beloved child-friendly cult classics.\\xa0 The original has also become a fall-season staple with marathon viewings frequently featured during Freeform’s annual 31 Nights of Halloween.', '\"I bet you\\'re looking for the stage?\"   \"Always,\" Midler says, implying that another musical performance — a la \"I Put a Spell on You\" from the original movie — will be on the way.   Teaser footage from Hocus Pocus 2 was first shown at the company\\'s upfronts presentation back in May.   Attendees also got a sneak peek of the film, featuring the three leads covering \"The Bitch Is Back\" by Elton John as well as an appearance from zombie with a heart of gold Billy Butcherson (Doug Jones, reprising his role from the first film).   The clip also showed new characters including the mayor of Salem (Tony Hale) and another played by Sam Richardson, who also appeared in Tuesday\\'s official teaser trailer.   As seen in that clip, Gossip Girl\\'s Whitney Peak and American Horror Stories\\' Belissa Escobedo are the two teens who bring the Sanderson Sisters back to life. Lilia Buckingham (Dirt) plays the third teen who teams with Peak and Escobedo\\'s characters to battle the Sanderson Sisters.   Doug Jones (The Shape of Water), Hannah Waddingham (Ted Lasso), and Froylan Gutierrez (Teen Wolf) will also appear in the movie, according to the release.']\n",
